  abstract        = {Morphoanatomical MRI methods have recently begun to be applied in the mouse. However, substantial differences in the anatomical organisation of human and rodent brain prevent a straightforward extension of clinical neuroimaging tools to mouse brain imaging. As a result, the vast majority of the published approaches rely on tailored routines that address single morphoanatomical readouts and typically lack a sufficiently-detailed description of the complex workflow required to process images and quantify structural alterations. Here we provide a detailed description of semi-automated registration-based procedures for voxel based morphometry, cortical thickness estimation and automated anatomical labelling of the mouse brain. The approach relies on the sequential use of advanced image processing tools offered by ANTs, a flexible open source toolkit freely available to the scientific community. To illustrate our procedures, we described their application to quantify morphological alterations in socially-impaired BTBR mice with respect to normosocial C57BL/6J controls, a comparison recently described by us and other research groups. We show that the approach can reliably detect both focal and large-scale grey matter alterations using complementary readouts. No detailed operational workflows for mouse imaging are available for direct comparison with our methods. However, empirical assessment of the mapped inter-strain differences is in good agreement with the findings of other groups using analogous approaches. The detailed operational workflows described here are expected to help the implementation of rodent morphoanatomical methods by non-expert users, and ultimately promote the use of these tools across the preclinical neuroimaging community.},

  abstract        = {The marmoset is an emerging animal model for large-scale attempts to understand primate brain connectivity, but achieving this aim requires the development and validation of procedures for normalization and integration of results from many neuroanatomical experiments. Here we describe a computational pipeline for coregistration of retrograde tracing data on connections of cortical areas into a 3D marmoset brain template, generated from Nissl-stained sections. The procedure results in a series of spatial transformations that are applied to the coordinates of labeled neurons in the different cases, bringing them into common stereotaxic space. We applied this procedure to 17 injections, placed in the frontal lobe of nine marmosets as part of earlier studies. Visualizations of cortical patterns of connections revealed by these injections are supplied as Supplementary Materials. Comparison between the results of the automated and human-based processing of these cases reveals that the centers of injection sites can be reconstructed, on average, to within 0.6 mm of coordinates estimated by an experienced neuroanatomist. Moreover, cell counts obtained in different areas by the automated approach are highly correlated (r = 0.83) with those obtained by an expert, who examined in detail histological sections for each individual. The present procedure enables comparison and visualization of large datasets, which in turn opens the way for integration and analysis of results from many animals. Its versatility, including applicability to archival materials, may reduce the number of additional experiments required to produce the first detailed cortical connectome of a primate brain. J. Comp.
