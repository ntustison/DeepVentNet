__Rationale and Objectives:__  We propose an automated segmentation pipeline
based on deep learning for ventilation-based quantification which improves on 
previously proposed methods in terms of computational efficiency while maintaining
accuracy and robustness.  The 
large data requirements for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel 
template-based data augmentation strategy.

__Materials and Methods:__ Convolutional neural network (i.e., U-net) models were 
generated using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel 
template-based data augmentation strategy.  Development and processing utilized
_ANTsRNet_---a growing open-source repository of well-known deep learning 
architectures first introduced here which interfaces with the Advanced Normalization
Tools (ANTs) package and the R statistical project.  Training (including template generation
and data augmentation) employed $500$ images.  Evaluation was performed on the
remaining 1?? images through comparison with a previously reported 
automated segmentation algorithm based on Gaussian mixture modelling with Markov
Random field (MRF) spatial priors.

__Results:__


__Conclusions:__ The proposed deep learning framework yielded comparable results as 
the MRF-based algorithm.  Such an approach reduces computational time without 
sacrificing accuracy.
