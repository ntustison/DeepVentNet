__Rationale and Objectives:__  We propose an automated segmentation pipeline
based on deep learning for ventilation-based quantification which improves on 
our previously reported methodology in terms of computational efficiency while maintaining
accuracy and robustness.  The 
large data requirements for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel 
template-based data augmentation strategy.

__Materials and Methods:__ A novel deep learning approach based on convolutional 
neural network models (i.e., U-net) were 
generated using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel 
template-based data augmentation strategy.  Development and processing utilized
_ANTsRNet_---a growing open-source repository of well-known deep learning 
architectures first introduced here which interfaces with the Advanced Normalization
Tools (ANTs) package and the R statistical project.  Training (including template generation
and data augmentation) employed XXX images.  Evaluation was performed on the
remaining YYY images through comparison with a previously reported 
automated segmentation algorithm based on Gaussian mixture modelling with Markov
Random field (MRF) spatial priors.

__Results:__


__Conclusions:__ The proposed deep learning framework yielded comparable results as 
the MRF-based algorithm.  Such an approach reduces computational time without 
sacrificing accuracy.
