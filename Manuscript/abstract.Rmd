__Rationale and Objectives:__  We propose an automated segmentation pipeline
based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based 
quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in 
terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness.
The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a 
novel template-based data augmentation strategy.  Supporting this work is the 
open-source _ANTsRNet_---a growing repository of well-known deep learning 
architectures first introduced here.

__Materials and Methods:__ Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models 
were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function 
and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy.  Training (including 
template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 
functional lung MRI.  Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 
and 40 images, respectively.  

__Results:__ Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms
of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.87 $\pm$ 0.03, right lung:  0.88 $\pm$ 0.02, and
whole lung: 0.88 $\pm$ 0.02.  Although less accurate than our previously
reported joint label fusion (JLF) approach (left lung: 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02, 
right lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, whole lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01), processing time is 
$<$ 1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ~30 minutes per subject
using JLF.  Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based
on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect
regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously
reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.

__Conclusions:__ The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in 
near real time.  CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction 
and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of 
functional lung MRI.
