__Rationale and Objectives:__  We propose an automated segmentation pipeline
based on deep learning for ventilation-based quantification which improves on 
previous methods in terms of robustness and computational efficiency.  The 
large data requirements for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel 
template-based data augmentation strategy.

__Materials and Methods:__ Convolutional neural net (i.e., U-net) models were 
generated using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel 
template-based data augmentation strategy.  Development occurred within 
_ANTsRNet_---a growing open-source repository of well-known deep learning 
architectures first introduced here which interfaces with the Advanced Normalization
Tools package and the R statistical project.  Training (including template generation
and data augmentation) employed $500$ images.  Evaluation was performed on the
remaining 1?? images through comparison with a previously reported 
automated segmentation algorithm based on Gaussian mixture modelling with Markov
Random field (MRF) spatial priors.

__Results:__


__Conclusions:__ The proposed deep learning framework yielded comparable results as 
the MRF-based algorithm.  Such an approach reduces computational time without 
sacrificing accuracy.

__Abstract__

Probing lung function under a variety of conditions and/or pathologies
has been significantly facilitated by the use of hyperpolarized gas
imaging and corresponding quantitative image analysis methodologies. 
Such computational techniques permit automated (or semi-automated) 
quantification of spatial ventilation with increased reproducibility,
resolution, and robustness over traditional spirometry or radiological
readings.  Although multiple well-performing algorithms have been proposed
in the literature and are currently used in clinical research, recent
developments in maching learning (specifically deep learning) has 
generated new possibilities for quantification with improved capabilities
in terms of robustness and computational efficiency.  However, the benefits
of these approaches are realized at a cost of large data requirements.
In this work, we develop and evaluate a ventilation-based segmentation
framework for hyperpolarized gas magnetic resonance imaging.  To satisfy
the large data requirements of such a framework, we propose a novel
template-based data augmentation strategy for generating simulated data 
consistent with the population cohort.  To enhance relevance to the 
research community, we showcase this work in conjunction with the introduction 
of _ANTsRNet_---a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures 
which interfaces with the Advanced Normalization Tools package and the R 
statistical project.
