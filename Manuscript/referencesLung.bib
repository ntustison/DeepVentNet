	Abstract = {This paper introduces Quicksilver, a fast deformable image registration method. Quicksilver registration for image-pairs works by patch-wise prediction of a deformation model based directly on image appearance. A deep encoder-decoder network is used as the prediction model. While the prediction strategy is general, we focus on predictions for the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model. Specifically, we predict the momentum-parameterization of LDDMM, which facilitates a patch-wise prediction strategy while maintaining the theoretical properties of LDDMM, such as guaranteed diffeomorphic mappings for sufficiently strong regularization. We also provide a probabilistic version of our prediction network which can be sampled during the testing time to calculate uncertainties in the predicted deformations. Finally, we introduce a new correction network which greatly increases the prediction accuracy of an already existing prediction network. We show experimental results for uni-modal atlas-to-image as well as uni-/multi-modal image-to-image registrations. These experiments demonstrate that our method accurately predicts registrations obtained by numerical optimization, is very fast, achieves state-of-the-art registration results on four standard validation datasets, and can jointly learn an image similarity measure. Quicksilver is freely available as an open-source software.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of lung cancer screening programs will produce an unprecedented amount of chest CT scans in the near future, which radiologists will have to read in order to decide on a patient follow-up strategy. According to the current guidelines, the workup of screen-detected nodules strongly relies on nodule size and nodule type. In this paper, we present a deep learning system based on multi-stream multi-scale convolutional networks, which automatically classifies all nodule types relevant for nodule workup. The system processes raw CT data containing a nodule without the need for any additional information such as nodule segmentation or nodule size and learns a representation of 3D data by analyzing an arbitrary number of 2D views of a given nodule. The deep learning system was trained with data from the Italian MILD screening trial and validated on an independent set of data from the Danish DLCST screening trial. We analyze the advantage of processing nodules at multiple scales with a multi-stream convolutional network architecture, and we show that the proposed deep learning system achieves performance at classifying nodule type that surpasses the one of classical machine learning approaches and is within the inter-observer variability among four experienced human observers.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and validate a method for acquiring helium-3 ((3) He) and proton ((1) H) three-dimensional (3D) image sets of the human lung with isotropic spatial resolution within a 10-s breath-hold by using compressed sensing (CS) acceleration, and to assess the fidelity of undersampled images compared with fully sampled images.
METHODS: The undersampling scheme for CS acceleration was optimized and tested using (3) He ventilation data. Rapid 3D acquisition of both (3) He and (1) H data during one breath-hold was then implemented, based on a balanced steady-state free-precession pulse sequence, by random undersampling of k-space with reconstruction by means of minimizing the L1 norm and total variance. CS-reconstruction fidelity was evaluated quantitatively by comparing fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled image sets.
RESULTS: Helium-3 and (1) H 3D image sets of the lung with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution were acquired during a single breath-hold in 12 s and 8 s using acceleration factors of 2 and 3, respectively. Comparison of fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled (3) He and (1) H images yielded mean absolute errors <10% and structural similarity indices >0.9.
CONCLUSION: By randomly undersampling k-space and using CS reconstruction, high-quality (3) He and (1) H 3D image sets with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution can be acquired within an 8-s breath-hold.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This pilot study evaluated the effect of short- and long-term ivacaftor treatment on hyperpolarized 3He-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined ventilation defects in patients with cystic fibrosis aged ≥12years with a G551D-CFTR mutation.
METHODS: Part A (single-blind) comprised 4weeks of ivacaftor treatment; Part B (open-label) comprised 48weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was change from baseline in total ventilation defect (TVD; total defect volume:total lung volume ratio).
RESULTS: Mean change in TVD ranged from -8.2% (p=0.0547) to -12.8% (p=0.0078) in Part A (n=8) and -6.3% (p=0.1953) to -9.0% (p=0.0547) in Part B (n=8) as assessed by human reader and computer algorithm, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: TVD responded to ivacaftor therapy. 3He-MRI provides an individual quantification of disease burden that may be able to detect aspects of the disease missed by population-based spirometry metrics. Assessments by human reader and computer algorithm exhibit similar trends, but the latter appears more sensitive. www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01161537.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lung ventilation defects identified by using hyperpolarized 3-helium gas ((3)He) lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are prevalent in asthmatic patients, but the clinical importance of ventilation defects is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to correlate the lung defect volume quantified by using (3)He MRI with clinical features in children with mild and severe asthma.
METHODS: Thirty-one children with asthma (median age, 10 years; age range, 3-17 years) underwent detailed characterization and (3)He lung MRI. Quantification of the (3)He signal defined ventilation defect and hypoventilated, ventilated, and well-ventilated volumes.
RESULTS: The ventilation defect to total lung volume fraction ranged from 0.1% to 11.6%. Children with ventilation defect percentages in the upper tercile were more likely to have severe asthma than children in the lower terciles (P = .005). The ventilation defect percentage correlated (P < .05 for all) positively with the inhaled corticosteroid dose, total number of controller medications, and total blood eosinophil counts and negatively with the Asthma Control Test score, FEV1 (percent predicted), FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio (percent predicted), and forced expiratory flow rate from 25% to 75% of expired volume (percent predicted).
CONCLUSION: The lung defect volume percentage measured by using (3)He MRI correlates with several clinical features of asthma, including severity, symptom score, medication requirement, airway physiology, and atopic markers.},

@article{Svenningsen:2014aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperpolarised (3)He MRI provides a way to visualise regional pulmonary functional abnormalities that in asthma are thought to be related to airway morphological abnormalities. However, the exact aetiology of ventilation defects in asthma is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand the determinants of ventilation defects in asthma, we evaluated well-established clinical as well as (3)He MRI and X-ray CT airway measurements in healthy subjects and subjects with asthma.
METHODS: Thirty-four subjects (n=26 subjects with asthma, n=8 healthy volunteers) underwent MRI, spirometry, plethysmography, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide analysis, methacholine challenge and CT for a region-of-interest proximal to ventilation defects. For subjects who consented to CT (n=18 subjects with asthma, n=5 healthy volunteers), we evaluated 3(rd) to 5th generation airway wall area and wall thickness per cent and lumen area.
RESULTS: Seventeen subjects with asthma (17/26=65%) had visually obvious evidence of (3)He ventilation defects prior to bronchoprovocation and nine subjects with asthma had no ventilation defects prior to bronchoprovocation (9/26=35%). Subjects with asthma with defects were older (p=0.01) with worse forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (p=0.0003), airways resistance (p=0.004), fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (p=0.03), greater bronchoprovocation concentration of methacholine that reduced FEV1 by 20% (p=0.008) and wall thickness per cent (p=0.02) compared with subjects with asthma without defects. There was a moderate correlation for wall area per cent with ventilation defect per cent (r=0.43, p=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with asthma with (3)He ventilation defects were older with significantly worse airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation and airway remodelling but similar FEV1 as subjects with asthma without defects; hyperpolarised (3)He ventilation abnormalities were spatially and quantitatively related to abnormally remodelled airways.},

@article{Kirby:2014aa,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive value of imaging and clinical and physiological measurements of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) in patients monitored for more than 5 years for pulmonary exacerbations that required hospitalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were monitored over 5 years in 91 subjects who provided written informed consent. Study was local research ethics board and Health Canada approved and HIPAA compliant. Subjects with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) wall area and relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ( RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ), helium 3 ((3)He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging ventilation defect percentage ( VDP ventilation defect percentage ), and apparent diffusion coefficient were generated. Zero-inflated Poisson model was used to compare number of hospitalizations with lung function and imaging measurements.
RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were hospitalized 58 times and had significantly worse forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .02), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P < .0001) than values in 67 subjects who were not hospitalized. In mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nine hospitalized subjects had significantly worse FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = .02) and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .02) than values in 52 subjects who were not hospitalized. (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was quantitatively related to CT airway morphology (r = 0.26, P = .01) and quantitatively (r = 0.61, P < .0001) and spatially related to emphysema; this spatial relationship was significantly greater for hospitalized patients with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than unhospitalized patients (P = .0006). For all subjects, number of prior hospitalizations (P < .0001), 6-minute walk test distance (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .03), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .002) were significantly related to number of hospitalizations. For 61 subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , only (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was significantly associated with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (P = .01).
CONCLUSION: (3)He MR imaging VDP ventilation defect percentage represents a mixed airways-emphysema phenotype and helps identify subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk for exacerbation that requires hospitalization.},

@article{Tustison:2016aa,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose an accurate methodological framework for automatically segmenting pulmonary proton MRI based on an optimal consensus of a spatially normalized library of annotated lung atlases.
METHODS: A library of 62 manually annotated lung atlases comprising 48 mixed healthy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthmatic subjects of a large age range with multiple ventilation levels is used to produce an optimal segmentation in proton MRI, based on a consensus of the spatially normalized library. An extension of this methodology is used to provide best-guess estimates of lobar subdivisions in proton MRI from annotated computed tomography data.
RESULTS: A leave-one-out evaluation strategy was used for evaluation. Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs were used for performance comparisons relative to the current state-of-the-art (0.966 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.970 $\pm$ 0.016, respectively). Best-guess estimates for the lobes exhibited comparable performance levels (left upper: 0.882 $\pm$ 0.059, left lower: 0.868 $\pm$ 0.06, right upper: 0.852 $\pm$ 0.067, right middle: 0.657 $\pm$ 0.130, right lower: 0.873 $\pm$ 0.063).
CONCLUSION: An annotated atlas library approach can be used to provide good lung and lobe estimation in proton MRI. The proposed framework is useful for subsequent anatomically based analysis of structural and/or functional pulmonary image data.

	Abstract = {A computational framework is described that was developed for quantitative analysis of hyperpolarized helium-3 MR lung ventilation image data. This computational framework was applied to a study consisting of 55 subjects (47 asthmatic and eight normal). Each subject was imaged before and after respiratory challenge and also underwent spirometry. Approximately 1600 image features were calculated from the lungs in each image. Both the image and 27 spirometric features were ranked based on their ability to characterize clinical diagnosis using a mutual information-based feature subset selection algorithm. It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually. Interestingly, it was also found that spirometric values are relatively orthogonal to these image feature values in terms of informational content.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To improve intra- and interobserver variability and enable the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for multicenter, multiobserver studies, we generated a semiautomated segmentation method for hyperpolarized helium-3 ((3)He) MRI. Therefore the objective of this study was to compare the reproducibility and spatial agreement of manual and semiautomated segmentation of (3)He MRI ventilation defect volume (VDV) and ventilation volume (VV) in subjects with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The multistep semiautomated segmentation method we developed employed hierarchical K-means clustering to classify (3)He MRI pixel intensity values into five user-determined clusters ranging from signal void to hyperintense. A seeded region-growing algorithm was also used to segment the (1)H MRI thoracic cavity for coregistration to the (3)He cluster-map, generating VDV and VV.
RESULTS: We compared manual segmentation performed by an expert observer and semiautomated measurements of (3)He MRI VDV and observed strong significant correlations between the volumes generated using each method (asthma, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001; COPD, n = 5, r = 0.84, P < .0001; CF, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001). Semiautomated VDV had high interobserver reproducibility (coefficient of variation [CV] = 7%, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96); intraobserver reproducibility was significantly higher for semiautomated (CV = 5%, ICC = 1.00) compared to manual VDV (CV = 12%, ICC = 0.98). Spatial agreement for VV determined using the Dice coefficient (D) was also high for all disease states (asthma, D = 0.95; COPD, D = 0.88; CF, D = 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated segmentation (3)He MRI provides excellent inter- and intraobserver precision with high spatial and quantitative agreement with manual measurements enabling its use in longitudinal studies.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},

Imaging characteristics can be used to identify specific asthmatic phenotypes and provide a more detailed understanding of endotypes contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography can be used to assess pulmonary structure and function. It has been shown that specific airway and lung density measurements using computed tomography correlate with clinical parameters, including severity of disease and pathology, but also provide unique phenotypes. Hyperpolarized 129Xe and 3He are gases used as contrast media for magnetic resonance imaging that provide measurement of distal lung ventilation reflecting small-airway disease. Positron emission tomography can be useful to identify and target lung inflammation in asthmatic patients. Furthermore, imaging techniques can serve as a potential biomarker and be used to assess response to therapies, including newer biological treatments and bronchial thermoplasty.},

	Abstract = {In the past decade, hyperpolarized (HP) contrast agents have been under active development for MRI applications to address the twin challenges of functional and quantitative imaging. Both HP helium (3He) and xenon (129Xe) gases have reached the stage where they are under study in clinical research. HP 129Xe, in particular, is poised for larger scale clinical research to investigate asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and fibrotic lung diseases. With advances in polarizer technology and unique capabilities for imaging of 129Xe gas exchange into lung tissue and blood, HP 129Xe MRI is attracting new attention. In parallel, HP 13C and 15N MRI methods have steadily advanced in a wide range of pre-clinical research applications for imaging metabolism in various cancers and cardiac disease. The HP [1-13C] pyruvate MRI technique, in particular, has undergone phase I trials in prostate cancer and is poised for investigational new drug trials at multiple institutions in cancer and cardiac applications. This review treats the methodology behind both HP gases and HP 13C and 15N liquid state agents. Gas and liquid phase HP agents share similar technologies for achieving non-equilibrium polarization outside the field of the MRI scanner, strategies for image data acquisition, and translational challenges in moving from pre-clinical to clinical research. To cover the wide array of methods and applications, this review is organized by numerical section into (1) a brief introduction, (2) the physical and biological properties of the most common polarized agents with a brief summary of applications and methods of polarization, (3) methods for image acquisition and reconstruction specific to improving data acquisition efficiency for HP MRI, (4) the main physical properties that enable unique measures of physiology or metabolic pathways, followed by a more detailed review of the literature describing the use of HP agents to study: (5) metabolic pathways in cancer and cardiac disease and (6) lung function in both pre-clinical and clinical research studies, concluding with (7) some future directions and challenges, and (8) an overall summary.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the performance of a semiautomated ventilation defect segmentation approach, adaptive K-means, with manual segmentation of hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging in subjects with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six subjects with EIB underwent hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging and spirometry tests at baseline, post exercise, and recovery over two separate visits. Ventilation defects were analyzed by two methods. First, two independent readers manually segmented ventilation defects. Second, defects were quantified by an adaptive K-means method that corrected for coil sensitivity, applied a vesselness filter to estimate pulmonary vasculature, and segmented defects adaptively based on the overall low-intensity signals in the lungs. These two methods were then compared in four aspects: (1) ventilation defect percent (VDP) measurements, (2) correlation between spirometric measures and measured VDP, (3) regional VDP variations pre- and post exercise challenge, and (4) Dice coefficient for spatial agreement.
RESULTS: The adaptive K-means method was ~5 times faster, and the measured VDP bias was under 2%. The correlation between predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second over forced vital capacity and VDP measured by adaptive K-means (ρ = -0.64, P <0.0001) and by the manual method (ρ = -0.63, P <0.0001) yielded almost identical 95% confidence intervals. Neither method of measuring VDP indicated apical/basal or anterior dependence in this small study cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the manual method, the adaptive K-means method provided faster, reproducible, comparable measures of VDP in EIB and may be applied to a variety of lung diseases.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an image-processing pipeline for semiautomated (SA) and reproducible analysis of hyperpolarized gas lung ventilation and proton anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan pairs. To compare results from the software for total lung volume (TLV), ventilated volume (VV), and percentage lung ventilated volume (%VV) calculation to the current manual "basic" method and a K-means segmentation method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients were imaged with hyperpolarized 3 He and same-breath lung 1 H MRI at 1.5T and six other patients were scanned with hyperpolarized 129 Xe and separate-breath 1 H MRI. One expert observer and two users with experience in lung image segmentation carried out the image analysis. Spearman (R), Intraclass (ICC) correlations, Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA), and Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) between output lung volumes were calculated.
RESULTS: When comparing values of %VV, agreement between observers improved using the SA method (mean; R = 0.984, ICC = 0.980, LOA = 7.5%) when compared to the basic method (mean; R = 0.863, ICC = 0.873, LOA = 14.2%) nonsignificantly (pR  = 0.25, pICC  = 0.25, and pLOA  = 0.50 respectively). DSC of VV and TLV masks significantly improved (P < 0.01) using the SA method (mean; DSCVV  = 0.973, DSCTLV  = 0.980) when compared to the basic method (mean; DSCVV  = 0.947, DSCTLV  = 0.957). K-means systematically overestimated %VV when compared to both basic (mean overestimation = 5.0%) and SA methods (mean overestimation = 9.7%), and had poor agreement with the other methods (mean ICC; K-means vs. basic = 0.685, K-means vs. SA = 0.740).
CONCLUSION: A semiautomated image processing software was developed that improves interobserver agreement and correlation of lung ventilation volume percentage when compared to the currently used basic method and provides more consistent segmentations than the K-means method.

	Abstract = {Pulmonary imaging using hyperpolarized (3)He/(129)Xe gas is emerging as a new way to understand the regional nature of pulmonary ventilation abnormalities in obstructive lung diseases. However, the quantitative information derived is completely dependent on robust methods to segment both functional and structural/anatomical data. Here, we propose an approach to jointly segment the lung cavity from (1)H and (3)He pulmonary magnetic resonance images (MRI) by constraining the spatial consistency of the two segmentation regions, which simultaneously employs the image features from both modalities. We formulated the proposed co-segmentation problem as a coupled continuous min-cut model and showed that this combinatorial optimization problem can be solved globally and exactly by means of convex relaxation. In particular, we introduced a dual coupled continuous max-flow model to study the convex relaxed coupled continuous min-cut model under a primal and dual perspective. This gave rise to an efficient duality-based convex optimization algorithm. We implemented the proposed algorithm in parallel using general-purpose programming on graphics processing unit (GPGPU), which substantially increased its computational efficiency. Our experiments explored a clinical dataset of 25 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) across a wide range of disease severity. The results showed that the proposed co-segmentation approach yielded superior performance compared to single-channel image segmentation in terms of precision, accuracy and robustness. },

	Abstract = {In this study, hyperpolarized (129) Xe MR ventilation and (1) H anatomical images were obtained from three subject groups: young healthy volunteers (HVs), subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and age-matched controls (AMCs). Ventilation images were quantified by two methods: an expert reader-based ventilation defect score percentage (VDS%) and a semi-automated segmentation-based ventilation defect percentage (VDP). Reader-based values were assigned by two experienced radiologists and resolved by consensus. In the semi-automated analysis, (1) H anatomical images and (129) Xe ventilation images were both segmented following registration to obtain the thoracic cavity volume and ventilated volume, respectively, which were then expressed as a ratio to obtain the VDP. Ventilation images were also characterized by generating signal intensity histograms from voxels within the thoracic cavity volume, and heterogeneity was analyzed using the coefficient of variation (CV). The reader-based VDS% correlated strongly with the semi-automatically generated VDP (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001) and with CV (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001). Both (129) Xe ventilation defect scoring metrics readily separated the three groups from one another and correlated significantly with the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ) (VDS%: r = -0.78, p = 0.0002; VDP: r = -0.79, p = 0.0003; CV: r = -0.66, p = 0.0059) and other pulmonary function tests. In the healthy subject groups (HVs and AMCs), the prevalence of ventilation defects also increased with age (VDS%: r = 0.61, p = 0.0002; VDP: r = 0.63, p = 0.0002). Moreover, ventilation histograms and their associated CVs distinguished between subjects with COPD with similar ventilation defect scores, but visibly different ventilation patterns.},

@article{He:2014aa,
	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Clinical deployment of hyperpolarized (129)Xe magnetic resonance imaging requires accurate quantification and visualization of the ventilation defect percentage (VDP). Here, we improve the robustness of our previous semiautomated analysis method to reduce operator dependence, correct for B1 inhomogeneity and vascular structures, and extend the analysis to display multiple intensity clusters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two segmentation methods were compared-a seeded region-growing method, previously validated by expert reader scoring, and a new linear-binning method that corrects the effects of bias field and vascular structures. The new method removes nearly all operator interventions by rescaling the (129)Xe magnetic resonance images to the 99th percentile of the cumulative distribution and applying fixed thresholds to classify (129)Xe voxels into four clusters: defect, low, medium, and high intensity. The methods were applied to 24 subjects including patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8), age-matched controls (n = 8), and healthy normal subjects (n = 8).
RESULTS: Linear-binning enabled a faster and more reproducible workflow and permitted analysis of an additional 0.25 $\pm$ 0.18 L of lung volume by accounting for vasculature. Like region-growing, linear-binning VDP correlated strongly with reader scoring (R(2) = 0.93, P < .0001), but with less systematic bias. Moreover, linear-binning maps clearly depict regions of low and high intensity that may prove useful for phenotyping subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Corrected linear-binning provides a robust means to quantify (129)Xe ventilation images yielding VDP values that are indistinguishable from expert reader scores, while exploiting the entire dynamic range to depict multiple image clusters.},
