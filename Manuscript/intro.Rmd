# Introduction

Probing lung function under a variety of conditions and/or pathologies
has been significantly facilitated by the use of hyperpolarized gas
imaging and corresponding quantitative image analysis methodologies. 
Such computational techniques permit automated (or semi-automated) 
quantification of spatial ventilation with increased reproducibility,
resolution, and robustness over traditional spirometry or radiological
readings.  Although multiple well-performing algorithms have been proposed
in the literature and are currently used in clinical research, recent
developments in maching learning (specifically deep learning) has 
generated new possibilities for quantification with improved capabilities
in terms of robustness and computational efficiency.  However, the benefits
of these approaches are realized at a cost of large data requirements.
In this work, we develop and evaluate a ventilation-based segmentation
framework for hyperpolarized gas magnetic resonance imaging.  To satisfy
the large data requirements of such a framework, we propose a novel
template-based data augmentation strategy for generating simulated data 
consistent with the population cohort.  To enhance relevance to the 
research community, we showcase this work in conjunction with the introduction 
of _ANTsRNet_---a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures 
which interfaces with the Advanced Normalization Tools package and the R 
statistical project.
