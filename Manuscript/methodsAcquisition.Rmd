## _Image acquisition_

Both proton and ventilation images used for this study were taken from current and
previous studies from our group. Ventilation images comprised both Helium-3 and 
Xenon-129 acquisitions as our current segmentation processing does not distinguish 
between ventilation gas acquisition protocols and we expected similar agnosticism 
for the proposed approach.

Hyperpolarized MR image acquisition was performed under an Institutional Review
Board (IRB)-approved protocol with written informed consent obtained from each 
subject. In addition, all imaging studies was performed under Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved physicianâ€™s Investigational New Drug applications 
for hyperpolarized gas (either Helium-3 and Xenon-129). MRI data were acquired 
on a 1.5 T whole-body MRI scanner (Siemens Sonata, Siemens Medical Solutions, 
Malvern, PA) with broadband capabilities and corresponding hyperpolarized-gas 
chest radiofrequency coils (Rapid Biomedical, Rimpar, Germany; IGC Medical Advances, 
Milwaukee, WI; or Clinical MR Solutions, Brookfield, WI). 

Two imaging protocols were used to acquire the MR images. Both of them are combined 
hyperpolarized gas (helium-3 or xenon-129) and proton imaging acquisitions. Protocol 1
uses 3-D balanced steady-state free-precession or spoiled gradient-echo pulse 
sequences with isotropic resolution = 3.9 mm, TR = 1.75--1.85 ms, TE = 0.78--0.82 ms, 
flip angle= 9-10$^\circ$, bandwidth per pixel=1050-1100 Hz/Pixel, total duration = 10--20 
seconds. Protocol 2 uses a contiguous, coronal, 2-D gradient-echo pulse 
sequence with interleaved spiral sampling scheme, in-plane resolution = 2--4 mm, slice 
thickness = 15 mm, TR = 8--8.5 ms, TE = 0.8--1.0 ms, flip angle = 20$^\circ$ 
interleaves = 12--20 (plus 2 for field map), total duration = 3--8 seconds. 
All subjects provided written informed consent and the data were de-identified 
prior to analysis.
